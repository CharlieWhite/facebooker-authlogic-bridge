This is a Skeleton Application bridging a rails web application using Authlogic and Facebook Connect, as well as a native
Facebook Canvas Application.

The web application is hosted free at http://facebooker-authlogic-bridge.heroku.com/

The Facebook application is located at http://apps.facebook.com/fb-authlogic-bridge/

The code is hosted at Github here, http://github.com/fluidtickets/facebooker-authlogic-bridge
 
and can be cloned here: git@github.com:fluidtickets/facebooker-authlogic-bridge.git

This application is structured around the Authlogic example tutorial. It's definitely possible to clean this up within the Authlogic code, but i'll leave that to someone else.

I've use Facebooker to handle both Facebook Connect and Canvas applications.

ApplicationController#current_user handles getting the current user from the various possible sessions.

current_user can be used anywhere in the application, no matter how the user logged in.

Like in AuthLogic, require_user and require_no_user can be used as before filters.

The before filter :check_if_fb_app_installed? ensures that the canvas app was explicitly added by the user. Facebook won't pass the correct session_key otherwise.

BUG ALERT: There is currently a bug when logging out of facebook connect on the web app. You need to click Facebook's logout button twice.
If anyone has a fix for this, please email me at charlie@fluidtickets.com
